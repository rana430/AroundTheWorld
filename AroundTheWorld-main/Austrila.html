                <h2>Australia</h2>
                <p>Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. With an area of 7,617,930 square kilometres , Australia is the largest country by area in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country. Australia is the oldest, flattest, and driest inhabited continent, with the least fertile soils. It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, and mountain ranges in the south-east.</p>

                <p>The world-famous leaning tower is known around the globe for its incredible four-degree tilt that makes it seem as if the tower is about to topple over. The amazing slanted belltower sits behind Pisa Cathedral and was built in the Romanesque style.Dating back to the 12th century, the tower took a whopping 199 years to complete, but began to slant during its construction due to soft ground on one side. Today, the tower  which stands at a wonky 55.86 meters tall  attracts tourists from far and wide who want to catch sight of the tower and snap pictures of themselves in front of it.</p>

                <p>Great Ocean Road is one of the world's top scenic drives. Built to provide employment during the Depression, the road stretches for 300 kilometers along Australia's rugged southeast coast, winding along plunging sea cliffs. It stretches from the surfing town of Torquay to the town of Allansford, near Warrnambool.

                    One of the top attractions of Great Ocean Road is Port Campbell National Park. This is where you can see the wind- and wave-sculpted rock formations known as the Twelve Apostles, London Bridge, the Arch, and Loch Ard Gorge. From the air, these rock formations look like giant puzzle pieces adrift along the coast, lashed by the pounding surf of the Southern Ocean.l</p>

                <p>Adventures abound in the Kimberley. Covering Australia's northwest corner, this remote and rugged region of red rocks, gaping gorges, scorched deserts, and cliff-fringed coast is ripe for exploring.

                    One of the top adventures in the Kimberley is the Horizontal Falls. Powerful tides of up to 11 meters gush through two narrow gorges, creating this jaw-dropping phenomenon. Hop aboard a jet boat and zoom across the sea through the seething falls. 
                    
                    Broome is the gateway.From here, you can soar along scarlet sea cliffs and gaze down upon the 800-plus islands of the Buccaneer Archipelago. Fly farther north to the wild beaches of Cape Leveque.

               <p>
                Nature takes center stage at Kangaroo Island. On this unspoiled island off South Australia's Fleurieu Peninsula, kangaroos hop along the powdery shores, sea lions and penguins frolic in the crystal-clear waters, and koalas cling to the fragrant eucalyptus trees.Diving is also excellent. You can spot sea dragons in the temperate waters, and dive shipwrecks off the island's coast.

               Kangaroo Island's top attractions are made by Mother Nature. See the striking, wind-sculpted rock formations, known as the Remarkable Rocks and Admirals Arch in Flinders Chase National Park. Explore vast cave systems.

Within its borders, you can explore monsoon rainforests, mangrove swamps, rivers, gorges, ancient rock paintings, wetlands, and waterfalls.

                    Kakadu is also home to an astounding diversity of wildlife. In addition to the many mammals, reptiles, and fish, more than 300 different species of birds make their home here, and both freshwater and saltwater crocodiles lurk in the wetlands.

                    Bronzed bodies, blond sand, backpackers, and surf – throw it all together and you get one of the world's most famous beaches. Only 15 minutes by car from Sydney's city center, Bondi Beach is a great spot for a taste of Sydney's beach culture. Bask on the golden sands, surf the breaks, or take a cool dip on a hot summer's day (but stay between the flags).

                <p>
                    One of the top reasons many people travel to Norway is to see its majestic fjords. Shaped by glaciers over an incomprehensibly long 2.5 million years or so, the towering U-shaped valleys and their carved cliffs create a stunning landscape that’s almost too huge to take in. Norway boasts over 1000 fjords, only a portion of which are visited en masse (like the Hardangerfjord and Geirangerfjord), meaning it’s still possible to find a slice of solitude. Taking a cruise ship is a great way to see the soaring walls of the fjords as the boat glides on the waters. Alternatively, hiking atop the fjords offers a birds-eye-view of the incredible landscape.

                <p>Versailles is a monument like no other; when it comes to palaces, Versailles definitely takes first place. This grandiose building was the main residence for French royalty from 1682 until the 1789 French Revolution.

                    The exterior of the castle is enchantingly ornate, but its interiors are no less impressive. Some rooms inside the building are as famous as the palace itself, such as the Hall of Mirrors with its opulent gilded decoration. The geometric Garden of Versailles is punctuated with conical trees and woven as canals and fountains.

                    Along with the Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of Australia's top architectural icons. Affectionately called "the Coathanger," this impressive feat of construction is the largest steel arch bridge in the world. It was completed in 1932, 40 years before the Sydney Opera House
