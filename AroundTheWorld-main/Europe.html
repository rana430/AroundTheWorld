                <p>The arteries of the old town, the canals of Bruges have long been the roadways that connect the city. Bruges originally sat on the banks of the river Reie; as the city developed, so did its charming waterways. The canals were dug from the river for commercial shipping in order to move essential goods and supplies around the town.

                    Bruges’ inner canals mark the old city walls and ramparts and make for a beautiful area to explore on foot or in one of the many tourist boats. Cruise past the numerous old overarching brick bridges, sail along small streams, and spot the scenic riverside houses.

                <p>The Colosseum is the perfect symbol of the power of the Roman Empire at its height. Dating back to 72 AD, it was designed to hold 50,000 spectators and was, at the time, the biggest amphitheater ever built. Here, all manner of public spectacles were shown – from animal hunts and executions to gory gladiator battles; it was even filled with water for mock sea battles.

                    Although practically a ruin, the Colosseum is still very much an icon of Rome. Step inside the arches and take a tour of the structure. Sit and imagine yourself as a spectator in Roman times, and the grand displays and spectacles that went on inside the ring

                <p>The Acropolis in Athens is a simply stunning sight. This monumental hill is the location of a number of ancient sites that date back to the 5th century BC. Some of the attractions that crown the Acropolis include the Temple of Athena Nike, the Erechtheion, and, of course, the Parthenon.

                    Constructed at the peak of the Athenian Empire in 447 BC, the Parthenon is a symbol of Greece and impresses with its innumerable columns. Dedicated to Athena, it became a Christian church in the 6th century AD and a mosque in the 1460s after the Ottoman invasion. After nightfall, the Acropolis is lit up with a glow that can be seen around Athens.

                <p>For almost 1,000 years, Hagia Sophia was the biggest cathedral in the world and is still a fantastic structure to set eyes on. Originally built as an Eastern Orthodox Cathedral in 537 AD when Istanbul was named Constantinople, Hagia Sophia became an Ottoman mosque from 1453 and is today a museum for all faiths to enjoy.

                    The dome of the Hagia Sophia is a marvel in itself, and the building as a whole perfectly reflective of Byzantine architecture – as well as Istanbul’s patchwork heritage. Walking around the building today, you can piece together the history of the city with its intriguing murals and interesting artifacts.

                <img src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/beautiful-palaces-in-the-world/alhambra.jpg" alt="">
                    

                <p>Built on the ruins of Roman fortifications in 889 AD, Alhambra is a combination palace and fortress situated in Granada, Spain. For almost 1,000 years, much of the Iberian peninsula was ruled by the Islamic Moors, with Andalusia (the area where Alhambra is located) being their longest-held territory.

                    Today, you can explore its citadel, the oldest part of the fortress, climb up its watchtower, explore the amazing Moorish gardens and courtyards, and be amazed at the delicate geometric patterns throughout the complex. The setting on the backdrop of the Sierra Nevada makes Alhambra that much more mystical.

                <p>
                    One of the top reasons many people travel to Norway is to see its majestic fjords. Shaped by glaciers over an incomprehensibly long 2.5 million years or so, the towering U-shaped valleys and their carved cliffs create a stunning landscape that’s almost too huge to take in. Norway boasts over 1000 fjords, only a portion of which are visited en masse (like the Hardangerfjord and Geirangerfjord), meaning it’s still possible to find a slice of solitude. Taking a cruise ship is a great way to see the soaring walls of the fjords as the boat glides on the waters. Alternatively, hiking atop the fjords offers a birds-eye-view of the incredible landscape.

                <img src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/beautiful-palaces-in-the-world/palace_of_versailles.jpg" alt="">
                    

                <p>Versailles is a monument like no other; when it comes to palaces, Versailles definitely takes first place. This grandiose building was the main residence for French royalty from 1682 until the 1789 French Revolution.

                    The exterior of the castle is enchantingly ornate, but its interiors are no less impressive. Some rooms inside the building are as famous as the palace itself, such as the Hall of Mirrors with its opulent gilded decoration. The geometric Garden of Versailles is punctuated with conical trees and woven as canals and fountains.

                <img src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/tourist-attractions-in-europe/canals_of_venice.jpg" alt="">
                    

                <p>Venice is the original canal city; every other canal city in the world is compared to Venice. The enigmatic waterlogged city is the site of more than 150 waterways and 400 bridges, including the famous Bridge of Sighs.

                    The main canal in Venice is the two-mile-long Grand Canal, which flows past St Mark’s Square and is lined with some of Venice’s historic architecture – from the Medieval to the baroque. Gondoliers punt visitors around wearing striped shirts and wide-brimmed hats, but boats on the river are not just for tourists; they are also used for everyday jobs such as rubbish collection.
